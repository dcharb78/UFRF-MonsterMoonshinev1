# Archive Directory

This directory contains temporary files, redundant validation reports, and intermediate files that were generated during the proof development process.

## Contents

- **Validation Reports**: Intermediate validation reports (superseded by `COMPLETE_VALIDATION.txt`)
- **Summary Files**: Redundant summary documents
- **Hash Files**: Intermediate file hash lists (final hashes are in `AUTHENTICATION.md`)

## Note

These files are kept for historical reference but are not needed for:
- Building the Lean proofs
- Validating the repository
- Understanding the proofs

All essential information is in the root directory files:
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `AUTHENTICATION.md` - File integrity hashes
- `ADDITIONAL_PROOFS_PLAN.md` - Future work
- `VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md` - Validation approaches

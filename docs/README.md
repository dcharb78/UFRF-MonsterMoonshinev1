# Documentation Directory

This directory contains planning documents and validation strategies for the Monster Moonshine UFRF proof.

## Contents

### Core Documentation
- **VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md** - Comprehensive validation approaches and methods
- **UFRF_ASSUMPTIONS.md** - Clarification of what is proven vs. assumed in the formalization
- **UFRF_FixedPoint.md** - Fixed-point analysis and implementation notes
- **B2_Validation_Summary.md** - Detailed explanation of B2 geometric derivation and theorems
- **MOONSHINE_INEVITABLE.md** - Vision piece on the inevitability of Monster Moonshine within UFRF framework (see B2 geometric derivation in `lean/Monster_Moonshine.lean`)

### Additional Resources
- **ADDITIONAL_PROOFS_PLAN.md** - Plan for additional theorems and proofs that could extend the current work
- **Formal Proofs for the UFRF → Modular j-Invariant Derivation.md** - Detailed proof documentation
- **A Physical–Fourier Derivation of the Modular j-Invariant from UFRF Geometry.md** - Physical derivation

## Note

These documents are for reference and future work. They are not required for:
- Building the Lean proofs
- Validating the repository
- Understanding the core proofs

The essential information is in the root directory:
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `AUTHENTICATION.md` - File integrity hashes
